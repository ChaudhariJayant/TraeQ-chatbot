The forex news trading strategy emphasises fundamental analysis, with traders forming forecasts about market shifts by considering economic indicators and global events.News trading attracts traders with the opportunity for rapid price movements and substantial profits in a short time. However, it comes with higher risks due to increased volatility and unpredictable market reactions. Proficient news traders quickly analyse news events and understand their potential impact on currency pairs.Example: The United States publishes the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report on the first Friday of every month. This frequently leads to substantial fluctuations in the USD and currency pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/USD and more. Traders who predict the NFP outcomes can strategically take advantage of the price changes immediately after the report is made public.Check out the most traded currency pairs.\\xa0\\xa0Types of News That Impact Forex Markets to TradeVarious news and events can influence the forex market differently. By understanding these impacts, traders can better anticipate market movements.\\xa0Economic Data ReleasesThe information includes inflation, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), and retail sales. Should inflation exceed forecasts, it may prompt speculation about the central bank’s likelihood of increasing interest rates, thereby strengthening the affected currency.Learn what causes inflation.Central Bank AnnouncementsSignificant fluctuations are common in the market due to decisions about interest rates, monetary policy statements, and speeches made by central bank officials. If the European Central Bank (ECB) suggests a potential increase in interest rates, the Euro could see an increase in value compared to other currencies.\\xa0Geopolitical EventsElections, trade negotiations, and conflicts can create market uncertainty. After the 2016 Brexit referendum, the GBP/USD pair experienced significant volatility as traders responded to the potential economic consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.\\xa0Unexpected EventsTraders may experience significant market fluctuations when reevaluating risk and the potential economic consequences after sudden government changes, natural disasters, or terrorist attacks.\\xa0\\xa0Types of News Trading Strategies for ForexTraders can utilise various forex news trading strategies to exploit the market’s reactions to news events. Those who focus on forex news use a range of tactics to benefit from the market’s response to news events. Some of the most commonly utilised approaches include:\\xa0Straddle Trading StrategyThe essence of the straddle trading strategy is placing both a buy order and a sell order on a currency pair shortly before a significant news release. This allows traders to capitalise on market movement in any direction following the news outcome. If the news release exceeds expectations, the buy order will be executed, and if the news is unfavourable, the sell order will be triggered. This strategy benefits traders anticipating significant volatility but needs to determine the market’s future direction.\\xa0How It Works:Pre-News Setup: Place a buy order above the current market price and a sell order below it. Both orders should have stop-loss levels set to minimise risk.Post-News Reaction: The market will likely move sharply in one direction after the news is released. The triggered order captures the movement, while the opposite is automatically cancelled.\\xa0Example: The decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve is imminent, and there’s uncertainty in the market regarding a potential rate hike. News traders use this strategy to place a buy order for the EUR/USD pair at 1.1850 (above the current price) and a sell order at 1.1800 (below the current price). If the Fed catches the market off guard with a rate increase, the US dollar could strengthen, leading to a decline in the EUR/USD pair and consequently triggering the sell order. The trader profits from the downward movement while the buy order is cancelled.\\xa0Fade the News StrategyThis strategy means going against the first market response to a news release. The idea is that the initial sharp increase or decrease in price is usually an exaggerated reaction and will be succeeded by a reversal, causing the price to return to its levels before the news. Mastering this strategy entails having a solid grasp of market sentiment and the skill to recognise overreactions.\\xa0How It Works:Response at the Start: Once the news is out, it’s wise to await a substantial market movement in a specific direction.Critical Moment: Identify when the price seems to be steadying or changing direction, then execute a trade in the opposite direction.Benefit from the Market Correction: When the market retracts, prices revert to their original levels, enabling news traders to profit from the pullback.\\xa0Example: If the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report exceeds forecasts by a considerable margin, there may be a sudden rise in the US dollar’s value. Nevertheless, a news trader employing the fade strategy could predict this surge in an exaggerated response. Before entering a short position, they will wait for signs of a reversal, like a temporary pause in price movement or the development of a reversal pattern in a shorter time frame. Capitalising on the retracement, the news trader could exploit price declines as the market undergoes corrections.\\xa0Breakout StrategyThe Breakout Strategy operates on the premise that essential news events can cause a breakout from a range or a consolidation pattern. Should a news event generate sufficient momentum, it has the potential to propel the price past crucial support or resistance levels, resulting in a pronounced directional shift. News traders use this strategy to capitalise on the momentum following a breakout.\\xa0How It Works:Before the News: Find a currency pair trading within a narrow range or consolidation pattern before an upcoming news event.Entry Order Placement: It’s recommended that entry orders be placed a little beyond the range so that the trade can be automatically executed during a breakout resulting from the news.Optimising Momentum Opportunities: Following a breakout, news traders capitalise on the momentum by employing trailing stops to secure profits as the price continues moving toward the breakout.\\xa0Example: If the Bank of England (BoE) is getting ready to announce its decision regarding interest rates, the GBP/USD pair has maintained a narrow range of 1.3800 to 1.3850 for multiple days. Should a breakout trader choose to place a buy order at 1.3860 and a sell order at 1.3790, an unexpected rate hike by the BoE could lead to the GBP/USD surpassing the 1.3860 level, thereby triggering the buy order. Consequently, the trader could exploit the upward momentum by adjusting the stop-loss to lock in profits as the price increases.\\xa0News Reversal StrategyThe News Reversal Strategy resembles the fade strategy but emphasises entering a trade after a notable reversal pattern emerges following a news-driven spike. Typically, this strategy is employed when the initial market response is considered unsustainable or unclear news announcements result in a swift reversal.\\xa0How It Works:Keep an eye out for the Spike: Pay close attention to the immediate market reaction once the news is announced.Reversal Pattern Recognition: Watch for indications that the original momentum is diminishing, such as candlestick patterns signalling a change in direction (e.g., Doji, Engulfing), discrepancies in technical indicators, or prominent levels of support or resistance.Seek Validation: When verifying a distinct reversal pattern, initiate a trade in the opposite direction of the initial trend.Aim for Pre-News Levels: Prices frequently revert to levels close to where they were before the news, establishing a profit target for the trade.\\xa0Example: The Euro sharply dropped from 1.2000 to 1.1900 after the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a dovish statement. However, the market quickly realised that the dovish tone was anticipated, and the initial response might have been an overreaction. An hourly chart displayed a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting a potential reversal. A trader utilising this strategy initiated a long position at 1.1910, anticipating a return towards 1.1980.\\xa0\\xa0How to Trade the News in ForexLearning how to trade the forex market based on news and choosing suitable news events requires research, analysis, and understanding of market expectations. Below is a detailed roadmap:\\xa0Step 1: Select the News EventsIt is essential to stay updated on upcoming significant news events that could impact the market. Economic calendars are invaluable for identifying forthcoming releases. Look for events like central bank announcements, job reports, and inflation statistics.Step 2: Analyze Market ExpectationsBefore the news release, assess what the market is expecting. For instance, the market expects a robust job report, but the actual data turns out to be less impressive, and the currency could experience a steep decline. Understanding these expectations helps in positioning trades.Step 3: Choose a BrokerFinding the right broker is essential for successfully executing forex news trading strategies. When starting your news trading adventure, seek out brokers with a strong reputation and tight spreads like ATFX. ATFX differentiates itself by providing an extensive array of products and competitive CFD trading spreads.Step 4: Set Up the TradeDepending on your strategy, traders should set up their trade before the news is released. When utilising the breakout strategy, consider placing entry orders at critical levels where you anticipate the market will shift in response to unexpected news.Step 5: Manage RiskNews trading can be unpredictable, so managing your risk exposure effectively is essential. Employ stop-loss orders to safeguard against significant losses and evaluate the magnitude of your trades to avoid overexposure.Step 6: React QuicklySignificant price movements triggered by news events offer the opportunity to earn high returns, allowing for the potential to make substantial profits quickly.\\xa0Pros and Cons of Trading the News in Forex\\xa0ProsConsPotential for High Profits: Substantial profits can be earned when news events cause significant price fluctuations, providing an opportunity to make high profits quickly.High Volatility: News trading can lead to highly unpredictable fluctuations, which, if not handled correctly, can cause significant losses.Clear Catalysts: News provides clear reasons for market moves, making it easier to understand and predict price action.Slippage: Sudden price movements may prevent your orders from being executed at the intended price, resulting in slippage.Opportunities Across All Markets: All markets offer opportunities due to the numerous economic releases and events each week, making news trading a frequent possibility.Psychological Pressure: Participating in news trading can induce psychological stress, demanding rapid decision-making and effective emotional management.\\xa0Key TakeawaysForex news trading strategies offer substantial rewards by leveraging market reactions to economic and geopolitical events. Traders can navigate volatility by understanding key news events, choosing the right forex news trading strategy, and managing risks. However, news trading carries significant risks, demanding thorough preparation, quick decisions, and robust emotional discipline.\\xa0Trade The News Today With ATFXWhether you’re an experienced trader or a beginner, trying out your new forex news trading strategies on a demo account is crucial before transitioning to a live account.

Some important factors to consider include your personality type, lifestyle and available resources.

News trading\\xa0strategyA news trading strategy\\u200b\\u200b involves trading based on news and market expectations, both before and following news releases. Trading on news announcements can require a skilled mind-set as news can travel very quickly on digital media. Traders will need to assess the news immediately after it’s released and make a quick judgement on how to trade it. Some key considerations include:Is the news already fully factored into the price of an instrument or only partially priced in?Does the news match market expectations?Understanding these differences in market expectations is crucial to success when using a news trading strategy.News trading strategy tipsTreat each market and news release as an individual entity.Develop trading strategies for specific news releases.Market expectations and market reactions can be even more important than news releases.When trading based on news releases, it’s vital that the trader is aware of how financial markets\\u200b operate. Markets need energy to move and this comes from information flow such as news releases. Therefore, it’s common that news is already factored into the assets price. This results from traders attempting to predict the results of future news announcements and in turn, the market’s response. A news trading strategy is particularly useful for volatile markets, including when trading oil and other fluctuating commodities.‘It's better to travel than to arrive’The above is a common trading motto. This motto suggests that it can be better to trade on price action before an announcement rather than simply waiting for the announcement. Doing so may protect the trader from the volatility than can follow a rumoured announcement. Learn about utilising a 'buy the rumour, sell the news\\u200b' trading strategy.Benefits of news tradingA defined entry and exit strategy. Entering and exiting a trade is based on how the market interprets the news, which is commonly outlined in a trader’s plan.Many trade opportunities. Every day, there are several news events and economic releases that can provide trading opportunities. You can follow crucial news announcements by monitoring our economic calendar.Drawbacks of news tradingOvernight risk. Depending on the type of news, trading positions may be open over several days. Any positions that are left open overnight incur overnight risk.News trading requires expert skills. News traders need to understand how certain announcements will affect their positions and the wider financial market. Additionally, they need to be able to understand news from a market perspective and not only subjectively.Join a trading community committed to your successStart with a live accountStart with a demo2. End-of-day trading strategyThe end-of-day trading strategy involves trading near the close of markets. End-of-day traders become active when it becomes clear that the price is going to ‘settle’ or close.This strategy requires the studying of price action in comparison to the previous day’s price movements. End-of-day traders can then speculate how the price could move based on the price action and decide on any indicators that they are using in their system. Traders should create a set of risk management orders including a limit order\\u200b, a stop-loss order and a take-profit order to reduce any overnight risk.This style of trading requires less time commitment than other trading strategies. This is because there is only a need to study charts at their opening and closing times.Benefits of end-of-day tradingIt’s suitable for most traders. End-of-day trading can be a good way to start trading, as there is no need to enter multiple positions.Less time commitment. Traders can analyse charts and place market orders either in the morning or at night, so it can be significantly less time consuming in comparison to other strategies.Drawbacks of end-of-day tradingOvernight risk. Overnight positions can incur more risks, but this can be mitigated if you place a stop loss order. Guaranteed stop-losses are even more useful to mitigate risks.3. Swing trading strategyThe term ‘swing trading’ refers to trading both sides on the movements of any financial market. Swing traders aim to ‘buy’ a security when they suspect that the market will rise. Otherwise, they can ‘sell’ an asset when they suspect that the price will fall. Swing traders take advantage of the market’s oscillations as the price swings back and forth, from an overbought to oversold state. Swing trading is purely a technical approach to analysing markets, achieved through studying charts and analysing the individual movements that comprise a bigger picture trend.Successful swing trading relies on the interpretation of the length and duration of each swing, as these define important support and resistance levels. Additionally, swing traders will need to identify trends where the markets encounter increasing levels of supply or demand. Traders also consider if momentum is increasing or decreasing within each swing while monitoring trades.Swing trading strategy tipsDuring strong trends, it’s possible to use retracement swings to enter in the direction of the trend. These points are also referred to as ‘pullbacks’ or ‘dips’ in an existing trend.When a new momentum high is made, traders will look to the highest probability trade, which is usually to buy the first pullback. However, when a new momentum low is made, traders tend to look to sell the first rally.Use our pattern recognition scanner to identify chart patterns as part of technical analysis.Read our article on strategies for swing trading stocks to help guide your own strategy.Benefits of swing tradingIt’s viable as a hobby. Swing trading can be more suitable for people with limited time in comparison to other trading strategies. However, it does require some research to understand how oscillation patterns work.Many trade opportunities. Swing trading involves trading ‘both sides’ of the market, so traders can go long and short across a number of securities.Drawbacks of swing tradingOvernight risk. Some trades will be held overnight, incurring additional risks, but this can be mitigated by placing a stop-loss order on your positions.It requires ample research. A lot of research is required to understand how to analyse markets, as technical analysis is comprised of a wide variety of technical indicators and patterns.Powerful trading on the goSeamlessly open and close trades, track your progress and set up alertsOpen a demo accountLearn more4. Day trading strategyDay trading or intraday trading is suitable for traders that would like to actively trade in the daytime, generally as a full time profession. Day traders take advantage of price fluctuations in-between the market open and close hours. Day traders often hold multiple positions open in a day, but do not leave positions open overnight in order to minimise the risk of overnight market volatility. It’s recommended that day traders follow an organised trading plan that can quickly adapt to fast market movements.Just before the open of the FTSE and other European markets, traders should look to study the support and resistance levels and the possible reactions to the previous night’s trading in the US, as well as moves that have occurred in the Far Eastern markets. Many traders look to trade European markets in the first two hours when there is high liquidity. Otherwise, traders usually focus between 12pm – 5pm GMT when both the UK and US markets are open.Benefits of day tradingThere is no overnight risk. By definition, intra-day trading requires no trade is left open overnight.Limited intra-day risk. A day trader only opens short-term trades that usually last around 1 to 4 hours, which minimises the likelihood of risks that may exist in longer-term trades.Time flexible trading. Day trading might suit people who desire flexibility with their trading. A day trader might enter 1 to 5 positions during the day and close all of them when objectives are hit or when they are stopped out.Multiple trade opportunities. A day trader can make use of local and international markets and can open and close many positions within the day, including taking advantage of 24/7\\xa0forex market hours.Drawbacks of day tradingIt requires discipline. Similar to other short-term styles, intra-day trading requires discipline. Traders should utilise a pre-determined strategy, complete with entry and exit levels, to manage their risk.Flat trades. This is when some positions do not move within the day, which is to be expected.5. Trend trading strategyThis strategy describes when a trader uses technical analysis to define a trend, and only enters trades in the direction of the pre-determined trend.‘The trend is your friend’The above is a famous trading motto and one of the most accurate in the markets. Following the trend is different from being ‘bullish or bearish\\u200b’. Trend traders do not have a fixed view of where the market should go or in which direction. Success in trend trading can be defined by having an accurate system to firstly determine and then follow trends. However, it’s crucial to stay alert and adaptable as the trend can quickly change. Trend traders need to be aware of the risks of market reversals, those which can be mitigated with a trailing stop-loss order.Several trend-following tools can be used for analysing specific markets including equities, treasuries, currencies and commodities. Trend traders will need to exercise their patience as ‘riding the trend’ can be difficult. However, with enough confidence in their trading system, the trend trader should be able to stay disciplined and follow their rules. However, it’s equally important to know when your system has stopped working. This usually occurs due to a fundamental market change, therefore it’s important to cut your losses short and let your profits run when trend trading.Trend trading strategy tipsStay alert for signs that the trend is ending or is about to change. Also, keep in mind that the last part of a trend can accelerate as traders with the wrong positions look to cut their losses.Decide the timeframe in which to follow the trend and try to keep this consistent.Benefits of trend tradingIt’s a useful hobby. Trend trading is suitable for people with limited time, after their trend identification system has been created.Many trade opportunities. A prevailing trend may offer various opportunities to enter and exit a trade. Additionally, trend trading may involve playing ‘both sides’ of the market.Drawbacks of trend tradingOvernight risk. Trend trades are often open over several days so they may incur more overnight risks than other strategies. However, this can be mitigated by placing stop-loss orders.Join a trading community committed to your successStart with a live accountStart with a demo6. Scalping trading strategyTraders who use a scalping strategy\\u200b place very short-term trades with small price movements. Scalpers aim to ‘scalp’ a small profit from each trade in the hope that all the small profits accumulate. As a scalper, you must have a disciplined exit strategy as a large loss can eliminate many other profits that have accumulated slow and steadily. Forex scalping is particularly common for trading currency pairs.A scalper would operate away from the common mantra “let your profits run”, as scalpers tend to take their profits before the market has a chance to move. As scalpers generally operate on a risk/reward ratio\\u200b of around 1/1, it’s common for scalpers not to make a large profit per trade, instead focusing on increasing their total number of smaller winning trades.Benefits of scalpingThere is no overnight risk. Scalpers do not hold overnight positions and most trades only last for a few minutes at maximum.It’s suitable as a hobby. Scalping is suitable for people who want to trade flexibly.Many trading opportunities. Scalpers open several small positions with a less defined criterion in comparison to other strategies, therefore there a lot of opportunities to trade on.Drawbacks of scalpingLimited market applicability. Scalping only works in particular markets such as indices, bonds and some US equities. Scalping requires very high volatility and trading volumes to be worthwhile. Learn more about volatility trading.Requires discipline. As scalping requires larger position sizes than other trading styles, traders need to be extremely disciplined.It’s an extremely tense environment. Monitoring the slightest price movements in search of profits can be an extremely intense activity. It’s therefore not recommended for beginner traders.7. Position trading strategyPosition trading is a popular trading strategy where a trader holds a position for a long period of time, usually months or years, ignoring minor price fluctuations in favor of profiting from long-term trends. Position traders tend to use fundamental analysis to evaluate potential price trends within the markets, but also take into considerations other factors such as market trends and historical patterns.Benefits of position tradingHigh profits. Position trading allows traders to use high leverage, as the possibility of a mistake is smaller than in conventional trading.Less stress. One of the biggest advantages of position trading is that positions don't have to be checked on a daily basis.Drawbacks of position tradingSignificant loss. Position traders tend to ignore minor fluctuations that can become full trend reversals and result in significant losses.Swap. The swap is a commission paid to the broker. If the position is open for a long period of time, the swaps can accumulate a large amount.What is the best trading strategy?When it comes to trading strategies, they can all perform well under specific market conditions; the best trading strategy is a subjective matter. However, it’s recommended to pick a trading strategy based on your personality type, level of discipline, available capital, risk tolerance and availability. You can practise any one of these trading strategies above on a demo trading account with a virtual wallet of £10,000.Selecting a trading strategySelecting a trading strategy doesn’t have to be complicated and you don’t have to stick with just one. A key thing to remember is that the best traders are adaptable and can change their trading strategy based on opportunities. Therefore, it’s a good idea to learn about each individual trading strategy and by combining different approaches to trading, you will become adaptive to each situation.Nevertheless, remember not to become disheartened if you encounter initial losses on your capital. Patience is key when learning to become a successful trader, and mistakes and losses are inevitable in order to grow and develop your trading skills.Successful traders often track their profits and losses, which helps to maintain their consistency and discipline across all trades.

Williams took the futures trading world by storm, sealing his stature in market history and occupying a space alongside other legendary market speculators such as the likes of Jesse Livermore.\\nHe entered the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading where he turned his $10,000 stake into over $1,100,000 in just one year–an 11,300% return in a live market. His daughter, the famous actress Michelle Williams, also won the same contest ten years later, using a similar, though updated, strategy.\\nIn 1987, did Larry Williams trade every shift in the market, scalping profits along the way? Did microtrends play into his futures trading approach–one that might have kept him glued to his screen, day trading or swing trading the nuances of each micro trend?\\nNone of that applied. And one can argue that this very principle is one major factor that contributed to his success.\\nLarry Williams traded one instrument–the S&P 500 futures–and placed only one trade a day upon opening bell. He placed a single trade daily based on End-Of-Day (EOD) data. And because of this simplicity, plus an exceedingly aggressive money management strategy called Optimal F, he was able to achive way above average results where he turned a 5-figure to a 7-Figure.\\n(Disclaimer: The example is for illustration only. These are uniue and excpetional results. You should not expect such returns. There is a substantial risk of los in futures trading. Past perforamnce is not indicative of future results.).\\nWhat is End-of-Day Trading?\\nEnd of Day trading is the process of deciding on and initiating a trading position based on an assessment of the previous session’s trading activity.\\nIt’s simpler than it sounds: you take a look at the trading activity at the end of the regular market close, and you decide on going long or short the market (or take no position at all) at the market open either the following morning or overnight (if it’s a 24-hour market).\\nDoing it is easy. The “how to” part is much more difficult, as there are nearly countless strategies you can use to take a position based on EOD data.\\nHow to Trade Futures at Market Close\\nWhen Larry Williams traded the S&P 500 futures in the 1987 championship, he used what he described as a “dumb setup.” It wasn’t the actual trading setup that made money, it was his use of a highly risky “Optimal F” money management strategy developed by risk manager Ralph Vince.\\nWe won’t get into the details of his system, but a “setup” can easily be imagined by filling in the simple equation: If X happens, then go long or short, and close position at the end of the day.\\nHere is one example of a strategy that any trader could have dreamt up (this is not a recommendation but a demonstration).\\nIf the market is trending down at the end of the day:\\n\\nOpen a short position and place a stop loss above the highest high in the day’s session.\\nIf there is a blowout day in your favor, don’t initiate a position after the market closes.\\nClose the position at the end of tomorrow’s trading day and repeat the process.\\n\\nHere’s what that might have looked like on the YM from June 11 – 22, 2021.\\n\\nHere’s another example of a somewhat “dumb setup” that might or might not have relevance:\\n\\nWhen the market has three up closes, go short the following day and close your position at the end of the day.\\nWhen the market has three consecutive down days, go long the following day.\\n\\nHere’s what that might have looked like in the ES from May 5 to June 15, 2021.\\n\\nAnd here’s another EOD system to use as an example (or something to build on and refine):\\n\\nWhen an instrument is trading above its 50-day simple moving average, go long on tomorrow’s session every time today’s session trades below yesterday’s low.\\nPlace a stop loss a fractional distance below the trigger session’s low.\\nClose your position at the end of tomorrow’s session.\\n\\nHere’s what that might have looked like for the NQ from December 18, 2020 to February 9, 2021.\\n\\nIf you’re looking to trade, or even day trade, based on end of day data, hopefully, your trading rules will be a bit more sophisticated and calculated than the ones in the examples above.\\nThere are many ways to develop systems based on end of day data–from news trading to simple trend following (as in a few of the examples above) to candlesticks and much more.\\nBut this is where we’ll stop, allowing you to develop your own coherent trading strategy.\\nBenefits of Trading End of Day Trading Strategies\\n1 – EOD Trading Doesn’t Disrupt Your Day\\nSitting in front of your computer, eyes glued to your screen is a bit overrated; and that’s assuming you can afford to spend your day scalping the markets. If you’ve got a business to run, then frequent intraday trading adds another layer of risk onto your plate–missing out on a trade and missing out on your business. EOD trading doesn’t get in your way, making your day-to-day activities, along with your trading, much more efficient.\\n2 – Less Stress\\nIF (and only if) you’ve developed a system that potentially returns more than it loses, and if you have the capital to let it run, then there’s no need to do anything else other than wait for end of day data to implement the strategy. Having said that, we do not recommedn leaving any orders unsupervised, ragdless of the trading frequency of your strategy. You should alway stay alert watch for any type of connectivity that could be disrupted.\\n3 – A More Affordable Alternative\\nThe death of a thousand stops, or slippages, or commission fees is something that every day trader has experienced at some time or another. If you’re not careful, these extra costs can even exceed your trading profits, especially during a slow or low-return day.\\n4 – Allows You to Capture the Bigger Move\\nThere’s nothing worse than ending the day with a small profit or loss when, at the end of the day, the market had made a colossal move in only one direction, up or down. How’d you miss it? Your frequency-based trading tactics prevented you from capturing a move that could have made a huge difference in your trading account. Perhaps, if you had held one position based on an accurate EOD reading–assuming that nothing in the markets disrupted your directional bias–you might have caught the entire swing. Trading frequency often fails to catch these monodirectional intraday moves. EOD trading is designed to catch them.\\nRisks of Trading End of Day Trading Strategies\\n1 – Exposure to Negative Overnight Developments\\nLet’s suppose your market of choice is sensitive to certain foreign market developments and the market moves against you overnight, stopping you out of your position, only to correct itself back in your favor. If you open your positions the same day it closes–something you can do if your futures instrument trades on a 24-hour basis–then you’re exposing yourself to overnight risk.\\n2- Missing Overnight Developments\\nLet’s suppose you trade one of the US stock index funds, and you open your positions in the morning when their underlying opens in the stock market. What if the big move you were anticipating in the futures market already happened overnight? That’s the risk of not exposing yourself to overnight moves.\\n3 – Earnings Releases Post Market or Federal Reserve Speeches Post Market\\nDuring earnings season, some companies report earnings after market close. If you trade a stock index futures instrument, you’re exposing your capital to risk if an earnings report post-market goes against you (depending on the direction you take in the market).\\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve members often give speeches in foreign countries, the timing of which may not coincide well with the US (think after midnight in the US). Should any of the messages conveyed by the central bank shake the market, you’re likely to miss it, which can be good (if it’s in your favor) or tremendously bad (if it’s not).\\n4 – Weekend Gaps\\nOne of the worst things that can happen to you is to hold an instrument into the weekend only to see it gap against you in a manner that puts you in a debit situation. -depending on how much capital you have in your account–when it happens, you’ll have more than just regret…you may end up in debt.\\nThe Bottom Line\\nTrading EOD is simple and much easier to execute. The hard part, however, is in strategy development, capital requirements and very large drawdowns–not only your entry and exit setups, but the money management system you use to optimize it. There are hundreds of ways to develop an EOD futures trading strategy. It is just a matter of using your skill first and testing it with sound calculation.\\nWant to test your own trading strategy with the capacity to rewind and fast forward?

Here you hold assets for several days or weeks to maximize profits.\\xa0\\nWe explain how this works, which swing trading strategies are suitable and how you can discover the necessary signals.\\xa0\\n\\nThe most important facts in brief:\\n\\nIn swing trading, we hold positions for longer than a day, up to several weeks or even months\\nSwing trading is merely a generic term for a trading style, the actual swing trading strategy depends on the person, goals and opportunities\\nSwing trades require less time and attention and are therefore also suitable for beginners and hobby traders\\n\\n\\nWhat are swing trades and swing trading strategies?\\nUnder the generic term \"Swing Trading\" summarizes strategies and trading styles that benefit from oscillations (swings) over several days or weeks. In doing so, the traders try to Exploiting ups and downs on the marketsthat arise as part of larger trends.\\xa0\\nThis is because the prices of an asset do not rise in a straight line from one point to the next; they fluctuate along the way. Swing trading strategies rely on these movements and thus benefit from market trends in multiple ways.\\xa0\\nIn contrast to the other two active forms of trading, the Scalping and the Day trading, can be found here No predefined end time. A position therefore does not have to be closed at the end of a trading day (as with day trading), but can remain open as long as the positive profit prospects remain.\\xa0\\nIf the indicators have changed and further gains are unlikely, experienced traders close their swing trades - this can be days, weeks or months later, depending on how strong and long-lasting a trend or swing was.\\xa0\\nSwing trading strategies are therefore considered to be the longest form of active trading: here, positions are also held overnight and profits maximized.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, swing trading strategies differ from traditional investing, as the plan is to sell the assets from the outset, i.e. the aim is to generate returns through trading, not just long-term holding.\\xa0\\n\\nHow swing trades work in practice\\nFor swing trades, you rely on lucrative positions that can be held for several days - provided this is worthwhile. Therefore, the entire Swing trading process comparatively leisurely ab: It is generally not necessary to sit in front of a screen and monitor the development of business.\\xa0\\nA regular Check, for example, once a day, is sufficient for many swing trading strategies. You also need to plan time and energy for analyzing worthwhile trades. However, as the number of open positions is usually limited, the effort required here is also limited.\\xa0\\nMany swing trading strategies are also suitable also for trading in calm market conditions or long-term sideways movement. The up and down movements necessary for swing trading are also at least partially present in such phases and enable us to make solid profits.\\xa0\\nOther traders must either switch to another, more volatile asset or take a break during periods without a recognizable direction. A third option is financial instruments with extremely high leverage: they can generate high profits even with the smallest price changes, but are also correspondingly risky.\\xa0\\nSince even the slightest movement Stop-loss order can be triggered, losses are quite frequent with such leverage products.\\xa0\\nAll three options for sideways-moving markets are not very attractive; with Swing trading strategies give you a clear advantage in such phases, as you can continue to generate an attractive return without increasing risk.\\xa0\\n\\nSwing trading strategies: Ideal for beginners and professionals?\\nDue to the manageable effort involved, swing trading is also suitable for professionals who want to be active on the markets alongside a regular job. Scalping and day trading, on the other hand, are time-consuming full-time activities and are hardly suitable as a hobby.\\xa0\\nWith swing trading, it is sufficient to check your own positions once a day; active swing traders also log in three times a day - at the closing bell of the major international stock exchanges.\\xa0\\nHowever, these are not \"hard targets\" as with other trading methods! Swing trading strategies are much more flexible overall and also represent a significantly lower psychological burden.\\xa0\\nIt is hardly surprising that swing trading strategies statistically the best results for private individuals deliver. Whereas newcomers in particular lose enormous sums when starting out with day trading or scalping, the entry with swing trades is comparatively successful.\\xa0\\nAlthough there is also a considerable risk here, the absolute figures are significantly less disastrous than in day trading, for example, where only a small, single-digit percentage makes long-term profits.\\xa0\\nIn contrast to the other two forms of trading, swing trading strategies are also less hecticTrader do not have to sit in front of the screen with maximum attention and wait for the right moment.\\xa0\\nDue to the slower process, swing trades are less susceptible to careless mistakes that occur \"in the heat of the moment\".\\xa0\\nSwing trading strategies are therefore popular approaches for people seeking higher returns than long-term investors. In many cases Swing trades also as a transition to more intensive styles such as day trading or scalping.\\xa0\\nHowever, you do not automatically have to follow this path: swing trades are a separate discipline that is not automatically better or worse than other forms of trading.\\xa0\\nMany retailers have long-term success with their swing trading strategies. Switching to day trading or scalping, for example, is out of the question for them due to the significantly higher stress and risk involved.\\xa0\\nPart of the three active trading strategies\\nOn the financial markets, a distinction is made between several forms of trading and investing. The decisive factor here is not which indicators are used or whether a trader trades shares or forex pairs; instead, the time of an open position determines which category you fall into.\\xa0\\n\\nOf the three active forms of trading, swing trading is the \"slowest\", as only a few trades are executed each month.\\xa0\\nThe shortest intervals are found in the Scalping: Positions only remain open for a few seconds. Traders try to realize manageable profits in this short period of time, which should add up due to the high number of trades. It is a form of trading that requires mathematical and analytical understanding and a lot of time, as traders have to be actively at their desk.\\xa0\\nA little more time remains with the Day tradingbecause Here, positions can remain open until the end of the trading day. However, day traders avoid the dangerous phase from the close of the stock markets until the next opening. Here, the profits per trade are somewhat higher and the number per day decreases. Day trading also requires our full attention and presence in front of the screen.\\xa0\\nThe Swing Trading \\xa0is the slowest form of active trading. Here, positions remain open for more than one day, up to several weeks. The number of transactions is manageable, but the profits can be quite high. In addition, traders do not have to actively monitor their positions. A quick check per day is usually sufficient.\\xa0\\nIf even swing trading is still too active for you, you fall into the category of the Investing: Here is the destination, assets for months or years. Securities are only sold if no further positive development is expected in the long term. As a result, some swing trades can remain in our portfolios as positions for decades.\\xa0\\nSwing trading vs. swing trading strategy - which is which?\\nIt can sometimes be difficult to define what swing trades are and where it is more a matter of day trading or investment strategies. Even long-term investors sometimes sell a position after just a few days - however, in practice such transactions would not be described as swing trades.\\nConversely, it can also happen that planned swing trades have to be closed after just a few seconds. However, this does not make the executing trader a day trader!\\nThe same applies to the swing trading strategy: the The generic term \"swing trading\" does not specify any methodswith which you have to discover lucrative swing trades. Instead, it is a Trading style.\\xa0\\nYou can use moving averages, trend following strategies or any other approach to make your trading decisions. Many of the Swing trading strategies use the same analysis methods that are also used for scalping and day trading.\\nYou could therefore say that a swing trader is a person who sets out to exploit swings and closes out their positions over a period ranging from one day to several weeks.\\xa0\\nSwing trading strategies are another, very extensive field, that takes a closer look at the indicators and procedures of such swing trades.\\xa0\\nSwing trading strategies are particularly worthwhile in these markets\\nJust as the actual swing trading strategy is up to you, there are also no guidelines as to which assets should be traded. In general all markets conceivable: Shares, ETFs, Forex currency pairs, futures and many more.\\xa0\\nHowever, some swing trading markets have emerged, while others are less popular for swing trading strategies. Especially Share indices are suitable for beginners. In addition to the S&P 500, the Dax and the Nikkei, the Nasdaq 100 is primarily used here.\\xa0\\nIt has a comparatively high volatility and is therefore particularly suitable for swing trades. However, depending on your personal experience and swing trading strategy, this volatility can also cause problems!\\nThe Forex market is very popular for swing trading strategies. It is characterized by very good liquidity and sufficient volatility. Pairs of the most important currencies - the dollar, euro, yen and pound - are particularly suitable here. Swing traders often use Canadian dollars, Australian dollars or other \"major currencies\" as a combination.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe large selection for swing trades places high demands on the broker! Therefore, choose a provider with a large selection to avoid problems later on. Because even if your current swing trading strategy only requires a few assets, the demand can quickly increase later on!\\n\\nCapTrader can do that:\\nIt is not only the low costs that make CapTrader the first choice for active traders; the huge selection of over a million different assets also helps you to implement your swing trading strategy!\\n\\nIndicators and other tools for swing trading strategies\\nThe various Swing trading strategies often differ greatly; in most cases However, they use a common set of tools, with which you can recognize signals and use them for your swing trades. These indicators and key figures thus form the building blocks of the respective strategy.\\xa0\\nAll indicators, samples, key figures and other sources of information must be taken into account: They serve as Forecasting instruments, but do not constitute guarantees! Despite correct use, developments can occur in practice that do not match the predictions of chart patterns and the like.\\xa0\\nHowever, many traders also fail when implementing their swing trading strategy due to the use of indicators. For example, chart patterns can be misinterpreted because you focus on the wrong section of a graph ...\\xa0\\nIn any case, we recommend that you own swing trading strategy initially on a Demo account to try out! If you achieve reliable profits with your swing trades here, it makes sense to switch to a \"live account\".\\xa0\\nMoving average\\nThe Moving average is used to create a Average value of price movements to show. It reliably compensates for short-term outbreaks (peaks, troughs) and enables a more realistic view.\\xa0\\nFor the calculation a specific period is required. The longer the selected time interval, the slower the value reacts.\\xa0\\n\\nThe moving average (blue) of the S&P 500 Index (yellow) shows much less dramatic swings.\\xa0\\nA moving average is versatile and forms the basis for further calculations. It is designated as short-term (up to 50 days), medium-term (50 to 100 days) or long-term (100 to 200 days), depending on the time interval selected.\\xa0\\nThere are also numerous subtypes, such as the exponential moving averagein which the more recent values are weighted higher.\\xa0\\nFor swing trading strategies, for example, the moving average can be used to to indicate changes in direction. This is done by looking at a short-term and long-term moving average on the same chart. Intersections of the two graphs are important points of reference for swing trades.\\xa0\\nIf a short-term moving average crosses from below, traders usually see this as a sign of an upward movement. If, on the other hand, it crosses from above, a downward movement is to be expected.\\xa0\\nSince you want to profit from the swings during a movement with swing trades, the moving average is particularly important: it shows you the direction in which a trend is moving and helps you to predict changes.\\xa0\\nVolume\\nThe Volume is very easy to use for swing trading strategies, as no further calculations or special charts are required: It is a key figure that is available as standard and can be easily looked up.\\xa0\\nA look at the respective Trading volume allows conclusions to be drawn about the strength of a movementwhere a higher volume indicates a stronger trend. A lower volume, on the other hand, indicates a slowdown and possibly a subsequent reversal.\\xa0\\nSwing trades take place during a movement, i.e. in a trend. Thanks to the volume, you can always keep an eye on the \"health\" of the trend and make adjustments to your swing trading strategy.\\xa0\\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\\nHow many units of an asset are currently being bought and sold? This information is provided by the relative strength index RSI in a simple way. Its value fluctuates between 0 and 100 and indicates, whether a market is overbought or oversold.\\xa0\\nValues above 70 are considered a signal for an overbought market where a correction is to be expected. Many swing trading strategies provide for a short position in this case. If the RSI However, if the price falls below 30, an oversold condition is assumed and a rise is expected - ideal for swing trades in a long position.\\xa0\\nStochastic oscillator\\nFor your swing trading strategy you can Oscillators (\"vibrations\") in order to achieve a center line and thus identify trends. The Greek word \"stochastic\" refers to guessing or a dependence on chance.\\xa0\\nThe use of such stochastic oscillators is common in swing trading as well as in scalping and day trading. Stochastic oscillators are primarily used to changes between two trading periods.\\xa0\\nWe use a simple fact: if prices in one period were below the prices of the following period, there was an increase. If the trend was the opposite, the market moved downwards.\\xa0\\nIn order to use stochastic oscillators as trend indicators for a swing trading strategy, several trading periods are always used. A somewhat complicated formula is now used in an attempt, Predict trends, turning points and price movements.\\xa0\\nTogether with other key figures and indicators, the appropriate entry points for swing trading can be derived. Similar to the RSI, the oscillator fluctuates between 0 and 100. high value (usually 80 or more) as overbought, a low value (usually 20) as oversold.\\xa0\\nIn contrast to the relative strength index, however, the stochastic oscillator is always shown with a second line. This is a three-day moving average. If its line crosses that of the oscillator, many swing trading strategies assume that the markets will soon reverse direction.\\xa0\\nChart patterns\\nThe Analysis of optical indicators The analysis of an asset\\'s charts is an important discipline for traders: those who correctly recognize patterns such as triangles, pennants, wedges and more can use them to derive signals for their own trading. A number of swing trading strategies also rely on such chart patterns! The typical shapes include\\xa0\\nBull Flag\\nFrom a Flag is the term used in day trading chart analysis when a Rectangle, parallelogram or a rhombus is present. The special form of Bull flag on the other hand, does not necessarily represent an upward movement, but is almost always characterized by falling or sideways-moving prices marked.\\xa0\\nThis swing trading chart pattern gets its name from the fact that it often followed by a strong, bullish movement comes.\\xa0\\n\\nThe bull flag owes its name not to an upward movement within the flag, but to the upward trend that often follows.\\xa0\\nAscending triangle\\nMany swing trading strategies specifically look for Triangles in the charts Lookout. They allow for different interpretations, depending on the situation, in which direction the tip of the triangle points.\\xa0\\nFor example, a symmetrical triangle with the apex pointing neither up nor down is a possible signal for wait-and-see markets with an unclear direction. Swing traders can continue to profit here, but must be aware of the diminishing swings and the risk of a breakout.\\nA particularly popular swing trading chart is the upward-pointing triangle, also known as the \"bullish pennant\" called. It is a strong signal for an upward price trend.\\xa0\\nHere the apex of the triangle runs upwards, so that it is also referred to as an ascending trend line. Correctly recognized, the ascending triangle can be used for swing trades in long positions and contribute to the respective swing trading strategy.\\xa0\\n\\nA bullish pennant is often interpreted as an impending upward trend.\\nDouble bottom / double top\\nThe chart pattern of the double bottom is reminiscent of the letter \"W\" at first glance. Traders generally associate this figure with with an impending upward movement, which should begin at the second low point (the \"floor\").\\xa0\\nIf this expectation is met, profits can be realized through long positions. However, before the end of the double bottom, swing trades in short positions can also generate additional income.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith the double tip it works exactly the other way around: Here the a case is suspected after the second climax, so that short positions can be worthwhile. Both variants are popular patterns for different swing trading strategies.\\xa0\\n\\nThe double tip can be present in both directions and is reminiscent of the letter \"W\" or \"M\".\\xa0\\nIn addition to the chart patterns mentioned above, there are also numerous other forms, which each allow their own interpretations. Traders often focus on a few patterns that are particularly useful for their particular swing trading strategy.\\xa0\\nSwing trading strategies\\nWho Swing trades would like to use, should do not simply open positions at random - one Swing trading strategy is necessary, to act in a structured and potentially successful way!\\xa0\\nThe choice is very extensive. Which swing trading strategy suits you depends on various factors.\\xa0\\nFirst of all, your Swing trading strategy must be compatible with your framework conditionsAvailable time and capital, skills and previous knowledge as well as your willingness to take risks are particularly important.\\xa0\\nIn order to execute your chosen strategy, you must be able to place and monitor the necessary swing trades professionally, financially and in terms of time. Ultimately, however, you must decide for yourself which swing trading strategy appeals to you.\\xa0\\nTrend following strategy\\nIn swing trading, we try to benefit from the The ups and downs that occur during a trend. It is therefore a great advantage to recognize such overarching trends! The Trend following is a particularly simple and obvious swing trading strategy, that tries to do just that.\\xa0\\nThe trend following swing trading strategy however, does not specify, like such trends are recognizable - it only refers to the focus on such trends. Traders can choose from a variety of possible indicators, chart patterns and other key figures.\\xa0\\nOnce you have discovered an overriding trend, you can vbenefit from the smaller corrective movements along the way. You can vary between long and short positions, depending on the direction in which the sub-trend is currently moving.\\xa0\\nThis oscillation between positions gives swing trading its name.\\xa0\\n\\nThe trend following swing trading strategy uses longer trends to profit from the swings in their path.\\xa0\\nJust as important as recognizing a trend is the Identifying its endThe reversal movement must be supported by indicators (such as the volume or a crossing of the lines of the stochastic oscillator). detected in good time to avoid incorrect positions.\\xa0\\nThe trend following swing trading strategy allows us to take advantage of upward and downward trends. However, if a movement develops too quickly, you can run into problems with your swing trades and \"run behind the trend\".\\xa0\\nAlthough trend following is one of the simplest swing trading strategies, success is by no means guaranteed!\\nBreakout strategy\\nThe focus on Breakouts or \"breakouts\" is very obvious: if prices have been moving sideways for a long time without any major trends emerging, or have moved strongly in one direction, traders expect an imminent breakout with a significant (counter) movement.\\xa0\\nTaking advantage of these breakouts is a separate swing trading strategy, the breakout strategy.\\xa0\\n\\nA breakout often occurs after longer sideways movements.\\xa0\\nA pending breakout can be Identify in many ways and then use it for swing trades. One of the clearest signs is a high trading volume combined with high volatility.\\xa0\\nAccordingly, traders who follow a swing trading strategy based on breakouts specifically look out for these indicators. Especially when prices have been moving between a support and resistance line for a long time, a breakout becomes increasingly likely.\\nIf you place swing trades in anticipation of a breakout, you should prepare your positions above or below (depending on the expected direction) these lines.\\xa0\\nRange trading\\nThe Range trading like the Breakout Swing Trading strategy, relies on consolidating phases and sideways trends. In contrast to the breakout strategy, however, in range trading you try to trade successfully within these ranges and does not wait for a breakout.\\xa0\\nThat is why it is important, correctly identify resistance and support lines. If this is successful, we can open swing trades in short and long positions at these limits.\\xa0\\nThis allows us to benefit from upward and downward movements. As these also occur in markets without a clear trend, the range-based swing trading strategy a good possibility, to achieve at least small profits during sideways movements.\\xa0\\nRange trading requires a lot of experience and market knowledge, as breakouts can occur at any time. It is therefore aimed more at people who have been working with swing trades for some time.\\xa0\\nIf the price leaves the range we have defined (defined by resistance and support line), it develops contrary to our positions and causes losses. With this swing trading strategy, traders must therefore not only predict a breakout, but always hedge their positions accordingly!\\nThe range for range trading can also move in one direction, i.e. it does not always have to be a pure sideways trend. Fluctuating prices that move up or down within predictable lines are also suitable for this swing trading strategy.\\xa0\\nThis is also sometimes referred to as \"Trend channels\" or \"channels\", as the movements remain within an optical channel. Your swing trades should also lie within the boundaries of this channel in order to achieve the best results.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nA trend channel can point in different directions and is delimited by support and trend lines.\\nCOT Swing Trading Strategy\\nThe \"Commitment of Traders\" Report COT is a Overview of open positions on the US commodities market. This report is available Friday, after the close of US trading. You can use it to analyze the current situation and prepare swing trades for the following week.\\xa0\\nThis swing trading strategy can be only apply to the commodities market in the USA, This means that you can only trade futures or options with it. Unfortunately, there is no comparable report in other countries or other markets.\\xa0\\nThe COT allows us to implement various swing trading strategies. For example, you can discover particularly large long or short positions and use them to identify an imminent trend reversal.\\xa0\\nYou then place your own swing trades in order to also profit. However, you may also be expecting a different movement...\\xa0\\nThere are also complex COT signals and indicators available, which make calculations based on the report. They promise even deeper insights, but should be treated with the usual caution, as traders can also miscalculate here.\\xa0\\nAs the report provides a good basis for comprehensive analyses COT trading plays a special role among swing trading strategies and even represents a discipline in its own right.\\xa0\\nAdvantages and disadvantages of swing trading and swing trading strategies\\nSwing trading strategies work very differently and each has its own focus and problems. However, swing trading has some general advantages and disadvantages that distinguish it from other forms of trading. These include\\xa0\\nAdvantages\\n\\nSwing trading strategies are cheaper than day trading or scalping, as only a manageable number of trades are placed. While professional scalpers, for example, have to pay many thousands of euros per year in transaction costs, the expenses for swing trading are limited.\\xa0\\n\\nNevertheless, even with swing trading strategies, you benefit from a broker with favorable conditions, as several such swing trades are made per month.\\xa0\\n\\nYou can work with comparatively little time required successful swing trading. The positions placed run without your intervention and are hedged accordingly.\\xa0\\n\\nIt is therefore not necessary to sit in front of the screen for hours on end - a regular check, for example once a day, is enough.\\xa0\\n\\nSwing trades are based on long-term trends and developments. This makes this trading style better comprehensible and also less mathematical and theoretical than scalping, for example.\\xa0\\n\\nMany traders enjoy this real handling of assets more than the abstract calculations of faster forms of trading.\\xa0\\n\\nDepending on the swing trading strategy and successful implementation high profits on the traders.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Getting started with swing trading is comparatively easy and can be learned in a reasonable amount of time. You can often place your first successful swing trades after just a few days.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDepending on the swing trading strategy you choose, you can largely ignore current news, fundamental data and similar aspects. This makes your work even easier.\\xa0\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nSwing trading involves considerable risks for your capital. Although the risks are lower than with other trading styles, swing trades can by no means be described as \"safe\"!\\nSwing trading offers not the same thrill like the fast forms of trading. If you want to increase your pulse by trading, you should rather try day trading or scalping ...\\n\\n\\nMost swing trading strategies are quite leisurely and do not require much attention from the trader. If you tend to be impatient or are generally looking for a more active occupation, you may be in the wrong place here.\\xa0\\n\\nThe long periods of inactivity also encourage some people to open unfavorable and risky positions out of boredom.\\xa0\\n\\nThere are often significant price changes between two trading days. While day traders and scalpers avoid this critical phase by closing their positions, swing traders are fully affected by them.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDue to the longer term of a position, a Stop-loss order also at a corresponding distance are placed. In an emergency, this leads to higher losses per negative trade.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost swing trading strategies are straightforward in difficulties during highly volatile market phases and can lead to higher risks.\\xa0\\n\\nConclusion: Swing trading strategies as an introduction to trading\\nSwing trading receives less attention than day trading and scalping. This is mainly due to the fact that Swing trading strategies less exciting and risky are - but they still deliver, if executed correctly, quite handsome returns.\\xa0\\nDue to the Swing trading is also suitable for working people because it is less time-consuming - which cannot be said of day trading and scalping!\\nSwing trading gets its name from the swinging movements that occur on the markets as part of a trend. Even on the way up or down, there are always short reversals - swing trading strategies take advantage of these and place lucrative positions.\\xa0\\nLike other trading styles, swing trading can be \\xa0can be carried out using a wide variety of methods. Most swing trading strategies rely on typical indicators and ratios to detect signals for upcoming movements. For example, volumes, relative strength indices or the moving average are used.\\xa0\\nMost swing trading strategies focus on the Discover reversal points, where trends start, end or change direction. However, with swing trading strategies such as range trading, it is quite possible to make profits even during longer sideways movements.\\xa0\\nOverall, swing trading offers a very good introduction to active stock market trading. Beginners in particular are well advised to choose this form over other styles.\\xa0\\nStatistically, they achieve the best results here. In case of doubt, however, the choice of swing trading strategy and correct execution are always decisive for long-term success.\\xa0\\nIf you would like to find out more about trading, we recommend the following blog posts: Day trading with shares and the Best app for trading. \\nFAQ - Frequently asked questions about swing trading strategies\\nWhat is the best swing trading strategy?No swing trading strategy is \"the best\" as its success depends on various factors.

The forex news trading strategy emphasises fundamental analysis, with traders forming forecasts about market shifts by considering economic indicators and global events.News trading attracts traders with the opportunity for rapid price movements and substantial profits in a short time. However, it comes with higher risks due to increased volatility and unpredictable market reactions. Proficient news traders quickly analyse news events and understand their potential impact on currency pairs.Example: The United States publishes the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report on the first Friday of every month. This frequently leads to substantial fluctuations in the USD and currency pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, CAD/USD and more. Traders who predict the NFP outcomes can strategically take advantage of the price changes immediately after the report is made public.Check out the most traded currency pairs.\\xa0\\xa0Types of News That Impact Forex Markets to TradeVarious news and events can influence the forex market differently. By understanding these impacts, traders can better anticipate market movements.\\xa0Economic Data ReleasesThe information includes inflation, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), and retail sales. Should inflation exceed forecasts, it may prompt speculation about the central bank’s likelihood of increasing interest rates, thereby strengthening the affected currency.Learn what causes inflation.Central Bank AnnouncementsSignificant fluctuations are common in the market due to decisions about interest rates, monetary policy statements, and speeches made by central bank officials. If the European Central Bank (ECB) suggests a potential increase in interest rates, the Euro could see an increase in value compared to other currencies.\\xa0Geopolitical EventsElections, trade negotiations, and conflicts can create market uncertainty. After the 2016 Brexit referendum, the GBP/USD pair experienced significant volatility as traders responded to the potential economic consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.\\xa0Unexpected EventsTraders may experience significant market fluctuations when reevaluating risk and the potential economic consequences after sudden'),\n",

Learn how to trade forex based on news with ATFX today!', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='government changes, natural disasters, or terrorist attacks.\\xa0\\xa0Types of News Trading Strategies for ForexTraders can utilise various forex news trading strategies to exploit the market’s reactions to news events. Those who focus on forex news use a range of tactics to benefit from the market’s response to news events. Some of the most commonly utilised approaches include:\\xa0Straddle Trading StrategyThe essence of the straddle trading strategy is placing both a buy order and a sell order on a currency pair shortly before a significant news release. This allows traders to capitalise on market movement in any direction following the news outcome. If the news release exceeds expectations, the buy order will be executed, and if the news is unfavourable, the sell order will be triggered. This strategy benefits traders anticipating significant volatility but needs to determine the market’s future direction.\\xa0How It Works:Pre-News Setup: Place a buy order above the current market price and a sell order below it. Both orders should have stop-loss levels set to minimise risk.Post-News Reaction: The market will likely move sharply in one direction after the news is released. The triggered order captures the movement, while the opposite is automatically cancelled.\\xa0Example: The decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve is imminent, and there’s uncertainty in the market regarding a potential rate hike. News traders use this strategy to place a buy order for the EUR/USD pair at 1.1850 (above the current price) and a sell order at 1.1800 (below the current price). If the Fed catches the market off guard with a rate increase, the US dollar could strengthen, leading to a decline in the EUR/USD pair and consequently triggering the sell order. The trader profits from the downward movement while the buy order is cancelled.\\xa0Fade the News StrategyThis strategy means going against the first market response to a news release. The idea is that the initial sharp increase or decrease in price is usually an exaggerated reaction and will be succeeded by a reversal, causing the price to return to its levels before the news. Mastering this strategy entails having a solid grasp of market sentiment and the skill to recognise overreactions.\\xa0How It Works:Response at the Start: Once the news is out, it’s wise to await a substantial market movement in a specific direction.Critical Moment: Identify when the price seems to be steadying or changing'),\n",

Learn how to trade forex based on news with ATFX today!', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='direction, then execute a trade in the opposite direction.Benefit from the Market Correction: When the market retracts, prices revert to their original levels, enabling news traders to profit from the pullback.\\xa0Example: If the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report exceeds forecasts by a considerable margin, there may be a sudden rise in the US dollar’s value. Nevertheless, a news trader employing the fade strategy could predict this surge in an exaggerated response. Before entering a short position, they will wait for signs of a reversal, like a temporary pause in price movement or the development of a reversal pattern in a shorter time frame. Capitalising on the retracement, the news trader could exploit price declines as the market undergoes corrections.\\xa0Breakout StrategyThe Breakout Strategy operates on the premise that essential news events can cause a breakout from a range or a consolidation pattern. Should a news event generate sufficient momentum, it has the potential to propel the price past crucial support or resistance levels, resulting in a pronounced directional shift. News traders use this strategy to capitalise on the momentum following a breakout.\\xa0How It Works:Before the News: Find a currency pair trading within a narrow range or consolidation pattern before an upcoming news event.Entry Order Placement: It’s recommended that entry orders be placed a little beyond the range so that the trade can be automatically executed during a breakout resulting from the news.Optimising Momentum Opportunities: Following a breakout, news traders capitalise on the momentum by employing trailing stops to secure profits as the price continues moving toward the breakout.\\xa0Example: If the Bank of England (BoE) is getting ready to announce its decision regarding interest rates, the GBP/USD pair has maintained a narrow range of 1.3800 to 1.3850 for multiple days. Should a breakout trader choose to place a buy order at 1.3860 and a sell order at 1.3790, an unexpected rate hike by the BoE could lead to the GBP/USD surpassing the 1.3860 level, thereby triggering the buy order. Consequently, the trader could exploit the upward momentum by adjusting the stop-loss to lock in profits as the price increases.\\xa0News Reversal StrategyThe News Reversal Strategy resembles the fade strategy but emphasises entering a trade after a notable reversal pattern emerges following a news-driven spike. Typically, this strategy is employed when the initial market response'),\n",

However, the market quickly realised that the dovish tone was anticipated, and the initial response might have been an overreaction. An hourly chart displayed a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting a potential reversal. A trader utilising this strategy initiated a long position at 1.1910, anticipating a return towards 1.1980.\\xa0\\xa0How to Trade the News in ForexLearning how to trade the forex market based on news and choosing suitable news events requires research, analysis, and understanding of market expectations. Below is a detailed roadmap:\\xa0Step 1: Select the News EventsIt is essential to stay updated on upcoming significant news events that could impact the market. Economic calendars are invaluable for identifying forthcoming releases. Look for events like central bank announcements, job reports, and inflation statistics.Step 2: Analyze Market ExpectationsBefore the news release, assess what the market is expecting. For instance, the market expects a robust job report, but the actual data turns out to be less impressive, and the currency could experience a steep decline. Understanding these expectations helps in positioning trades.Step 3: Choose a BrokerFinding the right broker is essential for successfully executing forex news trading strategies. When starting your news trading adventure, seek out brokers with a strong reputation and tight spreads like ATFX. ATFX differentiates itself by providing an extensive array of products and competitive CFD trading spreads.Step 4: Set Up the TradeDepending on your strategy, traders should set up their trade before the news is released. When utilising the breakout strategy, consider placing entry orders at critical levels where you anticipate the market will'),\n",

News trading\\xa0strategyA news trading strategy\\u200b\\u200b involves trading based on news and market expectations, both before and following news releases. Trading on news announcements can require a skilled mind-set as news can travel very quickly on digital media. Traders will need to assess the news immediately after it’s released and make a quick judgement on how to trade it. Some key considerations include:Is the news already fully factored into the price of an instrument or only partially priced in?Does the news match market expectations?Understanding these differences in market expectations is crucial to success when using a news trading strategy.News trading strategy tipsTreat each market and news release as an individual entity.Develop trading strategies for specific news releases.Market expectations and market reactions can be even more important than news releases.When trading based on news releases, it’s vital that the trader is aware of how financial markets\\u200b operate. Markets need energy to move and this comes from information flow such as news releases. Therefore, it’s common that news is already factored into the assets price. This results from traders attempting to predict the results of future news announcements and in turn, the market’s response. A news trading strategy is particularly useful for volatile markets, including when trading oil and other fluctuating commodities.‘It's better to travel than to arrive’The above is a common trading motto. This motto suggests that it can be better to trade on price action before an announcement rather than simply waiting for the announcement. Doing so may protect the trader from the volatility than can follow a rumoured announcement. Learn about utilising a 'buy the rumour, sell the news\\u200b' trading strategy.Benefits of news tradingA defined entry and exit strategy. Entering and exiting a trade is based on how the market interprets the news, which is commonly outlined in a trader’s plan.Many trade opportunities.

End-of-day trading strategyThe end-of-day trading strategy involves trading near the close of markets. End-of-day traders become active when it becomes clear that the price is going to ‘settle’ or close.This strategy requires the studying of price action in comparison to the previous day’s price movements. End-of-day traders can then speculate how the price could move based on the price action and decide on any indicators that they are using in their system. Traders should create a set of risk management orders including a limit order\\u200b, a stop-loss order and a take-profit order to reduce any overnight risk.This style of trading requires less time commitment than other trading strategies. This is because there is only a need to study charts at their opening and closing times.Benefits of end-of-day tradingIt’s suitable for most traders. End-of-day trading can be a good way to start trading, as there is no need to enter multiple positions.Less time commitment. Traders can analyse charts and place market orders either in the morning or at night, so it can be significantly less time consuming in comparison to other strategies.Drawbacks of end-of-day tradingOvernight risk. Overnight positions can incur more risks, but this can be mitigated if you place a stop loss order. Guaranteed stop-losses are even more useful to mitigate risks.3. Swing trading strategyThe term ‘swing trading’ refers to trading both sides on the movements of any financial market. Swing traders aim to ‘buy’ a security when they suspect that the market will rise. Otherwise, they can ‘sell’ an asset when they suspect that the price will fall. Swing traders take advantage of the market’s oscillations as the price swings back and forth, from an overbought to oversold state. Swing trading is purely a technical approach to analysing markets, achieved through studying charts and analysing the individual movements that comprise a bigger picture trend.Successful swing trading relies on the interpretation'),\n",

These points are also referred to as ‘pullbacks’ or ‘dips’ in an existing trend.When a new momentum high is made, traders will look to the highest probability trade, which is usually to buy the first pullback.

Day trading strategyDay trading or intraday trading is suitable for traders that would like to actively trade in the daytime, generally as a full time profession. Day traders take advantage of price fluctuations in-between the market open and close hours. Day traders often hold multiple positions open in a day, but do not leave positions open overnight in order to minimise the risk of overnight market volatility. It’s recommended that day traders follow an organised trading plan that can quickly adapt to fast market movements.Just before the open of the FTSE and other European markets, traders should look to study the support and resistance levels and the possible reactions to the previous night’s'),\n",

By definition, intra-day trading requires no trade is left open overnight.Limited intra-day risk. A day trader only opens short-term trades that usually last around 1 to 4 hours, which minimises the likelihood of risks that may exist in longer-term trades.Time flexible trading. Day trading might suit people who desire flexibility with their trading. A day trader might enter 1 to 5 positions during the day and close all of them when objectives are hit or when they are stopped out.Multiple trade opportunities.

Trend trading strategyThis strategy describes when a trader uses technical analysis to define a trend, and only enters trades in the direction of the pre-determined trend.‘The trend is your friend’The above is a famous trading motto and one of the most accurate in the markets. Following the trend is different from being ‘bullish or bearish\\u200b’. Trend traders do not have a fixed view of where the market should go or in which direction. Success in trend trading can be defined by having an accurate system to firstly determine and then follow trends. However, it’s crucial to stay alert and adaptable as the trend can quickly change. Trend traders need to be aware of the risks of market reversals, those which can be mitigated with a trailing stop-loss order.Several trend-following tools can be used for analysing specific markets including equities, treasuries, currencies and commodities. Trend traders will need to exercise their patience as ‘riding the trend’ can be difficult. However, with enough confidence in their trading system,'),\n",

Scalping trading strategyTraders who use a scalping strategy\\u200b place very short-term trades with small price movements. Scalpers aim to ‘scalp’ a small profit from each trade in the hope that all the small profits accumulate. As a scalper, you must have a disciplined exit strategy as a large loss can eliminate many other profits that have accumulated slow and steadily. Forex scalping is particularly common for trading currency pairs.A scalper would operate away from the common mantra “let your profits run”, as scalpers tend to take their profits before the market has a chance to move. As scalpers generally operate on a risk/reward ratio\\u200b of around 1/1, it’s common for scalpers not to make a large profit per trade, instead focusing on increasing their total number of smaller winning trades.Benefits of scalpingThere is no overnight risk. Scalpers do not hold overnight positions and most trades only last for a few minutes at maximum.It’s suitable as a hobby.

Position trading strategyPosition trading is a popular trading strategy where a trader holds a position for a long period of time, usually months or years, ignoring minor price fluctuations in favor of profiting from long-term trends. Position traders tend to use fundamental analysis to evaluate potential price trends within the markets, but also take into considerations other factors such as market trends and historical patterns.Benefits of position tradingHigh profits. Position trading allows traders to use high leverage, as the possibility of a mistake is smaller than in conventional trading.Less stress. One of the biggest advantages of position trading is that positions don't have to be checked on a daily basis.Drawbacks of position tradingSignificant loss.

Williams took the futures trading world by storm, sealing his stature in market history and occupying a space alongside other legendary market speculators such as the likes of Jesse Livermore.\\nHe entered the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading where he turned his $10,000 stake into over $1,100,000 in just one year–an 11,300% return in a live market. His daughter, the famous actress Michelle Williams, also won the same contest ten years later, using a similar, though updated, strategy.\\nIn 1987, did Larry Williams trade every shift in the market, scalping profits along the way? Did microtrends play into his futures trading approach–one that might have kept him glued to his screen, day trading or swing trading the nuances of each micro trend?\\nNone of that applied. And one can argue that this very principle is one major factor that contributed to his success.\\nLarry Williams traded one instrument–the S&P 500 futures–and placed only one trade a day upon opening bell. He placed a single trade daily based on End-Of-Day (EOD) data. And because of this simplicity, plus an exceedingly aggressive money management strategy called Optimal F, he was able to achive way above average results where he turned a 5-figure to a 7-Figure.\\n(Disclaimer: The example is for illustration only. These are uniue and excpetional results. You should not expect such returns. There is a substantial risk of los in futures trading. Past perforamnce is not indicative of future results.).\\nWhat is End-of-Day Trading?\\nEnd of Day trading is the process of deciding on and initiating a trading position based on an assessment of the previous session’s trading activity.\\nIt’s simpler than it sounds: you take a look at the trading activity at the end of the regular market close, and you decide on going long or short the market (or take no position at all) at the market open either the following morning or overnight (if it’s a 24-hour market).'),\n",

If you’ve got a business to run, then frequent intraday trading adds another layer of risk onto your plate–missing out on a trade and missing out on your business. EOD trading doesn’t get in your way, making your day-to-day activities, along with your trading, much more efficient.\\n2 – Less Stress\\nIF (and only if) you’ve developed a system that potentially returns more than it loses, and if you have the capital to let it run, then there’s no need to do anything else other than wait for end of day data to implement the strategy. Having said that, we do not recommedn leaving any orders unsupervised, ragdless of the trading frequency of your strategy. You should alway stay alert watch for any type of connectivity that could be disrupted.\\n3 – A More Affordable Alternative\\nThe death of a thousand stops, or slippages, or commission fees is something that every day trader has experienced at some time or another. If you’re not careful, these extra costs can even exceed your trading profits, especially during a slow or low-return day.\\n4 – Allows You to Capture the Bigger Move'),\n",

How’d you miss it? Your frequency-based trading tactics prevented you from capturing a move that could have made a huge difference in your trading account. Perhaps, if you had held one position based on an accurate EOD reading–assuming that nothing in the markets disrupted your directional bias–you might have caught the entire swing. Trading frequency often fails to catch these monodirectional intraday moves. EOD trading is designed to catch them.\\nRisks of Trading End of Day Trading Strategies\\n1 – Exposure to Negative Overnight Developments\\nLet’s suppose your market of choice is sensitive to certain foreign market developments and the market moves against you overnight, stopping you out of your position, only to correct itself back in your favor. If you open your positions the same day it closes–something you can do if your futures instrument trades on a 24-hour basis–then you’re exposing yourself to overnight risk.\\n2- Missing Overnight Developments\\nLet’s suppose you trade one of the US stock index funds, and you open your positions in the morning when their underlying opens in the stock market. What if the big move you were anticipating in the futures market already happened overnight? That’s the risk of not exposing yourself to overnight moves.\\n3 – Earnings Releases Post Market or Federal Reserve Speeches Post Market\\nDuring earnings season, some companies report earnings after market close. If you trade a stock index futures instrument, you’re exposing your capital to risk if an earnings report post-market goes against you (depending on the direction you take in the market).\\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve members often give speeches in foreign countries, the timing of which may not coincide well with the US (think after midnight in the US). Should any of the messages conveyed by the central bank shake the market, you’re likely to miss it, which can be good (if it’s in your favor) or tremendously bad (if it’s not).\\n4 – Weekend Gaps'),\n",

The hard part, however, is in strategy development, capital requirements and very large drawdowns–not only your entry and exit setups, but the money management system you use to optimize it.

This is done by looking at a short-term and long-term moving average on the same chart. Intersections of the two graphs are important points of reference for swing trades.\\xa0\\nIf a short-term moving average crosses from below, traders usually see this as a sign of an upward movement.

Stochastic oscillators are primarily used to changes between two trading periods.\\xa0\\nWe use a simple fact: if prices in one period were below the prices of the following period, there was an increase. If the trend was the opposite, the market moved downwards.\\xa0\\nIn order to use stochastic oscillators as trend indicators for a swing trading strategy, several trading periods are always used.

It is therefore a great advantage to recognize such overarching trends! The Trend following is a particularly simple and obvious swing trading strategy, that tries to do just that.\\xa0\\nThe trend following swing trading strategy however, does not specify, like such trends are recognizable - it only refers to the focus on such trends.

While day traders and scalpers avoid this critical phase by closing their positions, swing traders are fully affected by them.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDue to the longer term of a position, a Stop-loss order also at a corresponding distance are placed. In an emergency, this leads to higher losses per negative trade.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMost swing trading strategies are straightforward in difficulties during highly volatile market phases and can lead to higher risks.'),\n",

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that ‚Äúday traders buy, sell and short-sell stocks throughout the day in the hope that the stocks continue climbing or falling in value for the seconds or minutes they hold the shares, allowing them to lock in quick profits.‚Äù\\nA long-term investor, conversely, may buy a stock because they think that the company will grow its revenue and earnings, creating value for itself and the economy. Long-term investors believe that that growth will ultimately benefit shareholders, whether through share-price appreciation or dividend payouts.\\nA day trader, on the other hand, likely gives little credence to whether a company represents ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù value. Instead, they are concerned with how price volatility will push an asset like a stock higher in the near-term.\\nDay trading is a form of self-directed active investing, whereby an investor attempts to manage their investments and outperform or ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the stock market.\\nRecommended: A User‚Äôs Guide to Day Trading Terminology\\n7 Common Day Trading Strategies\\nSome common types of day trading strategies that you may want to research include technical analysis, scalping, momentum, swing trading, margin and so on. Here‚Äôs a closer look at them.\\n1. Technical Analysis\\nTechnical analysis is a type of trading method that uses price patterns to forecast future movement. A general rule of thumb in investing is that past performance never guarantees future results. However, technical analysts believe that because of market psychology, history tends to repeat itself.\\nSupport and resistance are price levels that traders look at when they‚Äôre applying technical analysis. ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù is where the price of an asset tends to stop falling and ‚Äúresistance‚Äù is where the price tends to stop climbing. So, for instance, if an asset falls to a support level, some may believe that buyers are likely to swoop in at that point.\\n2. Swing Trading'),\n",

The swings can be to the upside or to the downside and typically from a couple days to roughly two weeks.\\nGenerally, a swing trader uses a mix of fundamental and technical analysis to identify short- and mid-term trends in the market. They can go both long and short in market positions, and use stocks, ETFs, and other market instruments that exhibit volatility.\\n3. Momentum Trading\\nMomentum trading is a type of short-term, high-risk trading strategy. While momentum trades can be held for longer periods when trends continue, the term generally refers to trades that are held for a day or several days, on average.\\nMomentum traders strive to chase the market by identifying the trend in price action of a specific security and extract profit by predicting its near-term future movement. Looking for a good entry point when prices fall and then determining a profitable exit point is the method to momentum trading.\\n4. Scalp Trading\\nIn scalp trading, or scalping, the goal of this trading style is to make profits off of small changes in asset prices. Generally, this means buying a stock, waiting for it to increase in value by a small amount, then selling it. The theory behind it is that many small gains can add up to a significant profit over time.\\n5. Penny Stocks\\nPenny stocks ‚Äî shares priced at pennies to up to $5 apiece ‚Äî are often popular among day traders. However, they can be difficult to trade because many are illiquid. Penny stocks aren‚Äôt typically traded on the major exchanges, further increasing potential difficulties with trading. Typically, penny stocks sell in over-the-counter (OTC) markets.\\n6. Limit and Market Orders\\nThere are types of orders that day traders quickly become familiar with. A limit order is when an investor sets the price at which they‚Äôd like to buy or sell a stock. For example, you only want to buy a stock if it falls below $40 per share, or sell it if the price rises to over $60. A limit order guarantees a particular price but does not guarantee execution.'),\n",

Investors get the next price available at that time. This price may be slightly different than what is quoted, as the price of that underlying security changes while the order goes through.\\n7. Margin Trading\\nMargin accounts are a type of brokerage account that allows the investor to borrow money from the broker-dealer to purchase securities. The account acts as collateral for the loan. The interest rate on the borrowed money is determined by the brokerage firm.\\nTrading with this borrowed money ‚Äî called margin trading ‚Äî increases an investor‚Äôs purchasing power, but comes with much higher risk. If the securities lose value, an investor could be left losing more cash than they originally invested.\\nIn the case that the investor‚Äôs holdings decline, the brokerage firm might require them to deposit additional cash or securities into their account, or sell the securities to cover the loss. This is known as a margin call. A brokerage firm can deliver a margin call without advance notice and can even decide which of the investor‚Äôs holdings are sold.\\nBest Securities For Day Trading\\nDay traders can work across asset classes and securities: company stocks, fractional shares, ETFs, bonds, fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, or commodities like oil and precious metals. They can also trade options or futures ‚Äî different types of derivatives contracts.\\nBut there are some commonalities that day-trading markets tend to have, including liquidity, volatility, and volume.\\nLiquidity\\nLiquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought and sold without causing a significant change in its price. In other words, how smoothly can a trader make a trade?\\nLiquidity is important to day traders because they need to move in and out of positions quickly without having prices move against them. That means prices don‚Äôt move higher when day traders are buying, or move down when they‚Äôre starting to sell.\\nVolatility\\nMarket volatility can often be considered a negative thing in investing. However, for day traders, volatility can be essential because they need big price swings to potentially capture profits.\\nOf course, volatility could mean big losses for day traders too, but a slow-moving market typically doesn‚Äôt offer much opportunity for day traders.\\nVolume'),\n",

Elevated interest means there‚Äôs a greater likelihood of more liquidity and volatility ‚Äî which are, as discussed, two other characteristics that day traders look for.\\n\\uf8ffüí° Quick Tip: When you’re actively investing in stocks, it’s important to ask what types of fees you might have to pay. For example, brokers may charge a flat fee for trading stocks, or require some commission for every trade. Taking the time to manage investment costs can be beneficial over the long term.\\nDay Trading Basics ‚Äî How to Get Started\\nBefore starting to day trade, some investors set aside a dollar amount they‚Äôre comfortable investing ‚Äî and potentially losing. They need to figure out their personal risk tolerance, in other words.\\nGetting the hang of day trading can take some time, so newbie day traders may want to start with a small handful of stocks. This will be more manageable and give traders time to hone their skills.\\nRecommended: How Many Stocks Should I Own?\\nGood day traders can benefit from staying informed about events that may cause big price shifts. These can range from economic and geopolitical news to specific company developments.\\nHere‚Äôs also a list of important concepts or terms every prospective day trader should know.\\n1. Trading Costs\\nIf you‚Äôre utilizing day trading strategies, it‚Äôs wise to consider the cost. Many major brokerage firms accommodate day trading, but some charge a fee for each trade. This is called a transaction cost, commission, mark up, mark down, or a trading fee. Some firms also charge various other fees for day trading or trading penny stocks.\\nSome platforms are specifically designed for day trading, offering low-cost or even zero-cost trades and a variety of features to help traders research and track markets.\\n2. Pattern Day Trader\\nA pattern day trader is a designation created by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). A brokerage or investing platform will classify investors as pattern day traders if they day trade a security four or more times in five business days, and the number of day trades accounts for more than 6% of their total trading activity for that same five-day period.'),\n",

Otherwise, the account could get restricted per FINRA‚Äôs day-trading margin requirement rules.\\n3. Freeriding\\nIn a cash account, an investor must pay for the purchase of a security before selling it. Freeriding occurs when an investor buys and then sells a security without first paying for it.\\nThis is not allowed under the Federal Reserve Board‚Äôs Regulation T. In cases where freeriding occurs, the investor‚Äôs account may be frozen by the broker for a 90-day period. During the freeze, an investor is still able to make trades or purchases but must pay for them fully on the date of the trade.\\n4. Tax Implications of Trader vs Investor\\nThe IRS makes a distinction between a trader and an investor. Generally, an investor is someone who buys and sells securities for personal investment. A trader on the other hand is considered by the law to be in business. The tax implications are different for each.\\nAccording to the IRS, a trader must meet the following requirements below. If an individual does not meet these guidelines, they are considered an investor.\\n•\\xa0\\xa0 ‚ÄúYou must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities and not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation;\\n•\\xa0\\xa0 Your activity must be substantial; and\\n•\\xa0\\xa0 You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity.‚Äù\\n5. Capital Gains Taxes\\nAnother important tax implication to note is that the IRS differentiates between short-term and long-term investments for capital gains tax rates. Generally, investments held for over a year are considered long-term and those held for under a year are short-term.\\nWhile long-term capital gains may benefit from a lower tax rate, short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.\\nA capital loss occurs when an investment loses value. In certain circumstances, when a capital loss exceeds a capital gain, the difference could potentially be applied as a tax deduction. Some brokerages may also offer automated tax loss harvesting as a way to strategically offset investment profits.\\n6. Wash Sale Rule'),\n",

Or, they could stick with swing trades to test the waters, too.\\nPerhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that day trading is, as mentioned, incredibly risky.\\n\\uf8ffüí° Quick Tip: How do you decide if a certain trading platform or app is right for you? Ideally, the investment platform you choose offers the features that you need for your investment goals or strategy, e.g., an easy-to-use interface, data analysis, educational tools.\\nBest Times to Day Trade\\nAs mentioned, day traders seek high liquidity, volatility and volumes. That‚Äôs why when it comes to stocks, the first 15 minutes of the trading day, after the equity market opens at 9:30am, may be one of the active stretches for day traders.\\nThe stock market tends to be more volatile during this time, as traders and investors try to figure out the market‚Äôs direction and prices react to company reports or economic data that was released before the opening bell. Volume also tends to pick up before the closing bell at 4pm.\\nFor futures, commodities and currencies trading, markets are open 24 hours so day traders can be active around the clock. However, they may find less liquidity at night when most investors and traders in the U.S. aren‚Äôt as active.\\nDay Trading Risk Management\\nThe SEC issued a stern warning regarding day trading in 2005, and that message still holds value today. They noted that most people do not have the wealth, time, or temperament to be successful in day trading.\\nIf an individual isn‚Äôt comfortable with the risks associated with day trading, they shouldn‚Äôt delve into the practice. But if someone is curious, here are some steps they can take to manage the risks that stem from day trading:'),\n",

This is particularly important with options and margin trading. It‚Äôs crucial for investors to understand how leverage works in such trading accounts and that they can lose more than they originally invested.\\n2. \\xa0\\xa0 Investors and traders often benefit from tracking and monitoring volatility. One way to do this is by finding one‚Äôs portfolio beta, or the sensitivity to swings in the broader market. Adjusting one‚Äôs portfolio so it‚Äôs not too sensitive to sweeping volatility may be helpful.\\n3. \\xa0\\xa0 Day traders often benefit from picking a trading strategy and sticking with it. One struggle many day traders contend with is avoiding getting swept up by the moment and deviating from a plan, only to lock in losses.\\n4. \\xa0\\xa0 Don‚Äôt let your emotions take the driver‚Äôs seat. Fear and greed can dominate investing and sway decisions. But in investing, it can be better to keep a cool head and avoid reactionary behavior.\\nIs It Difficult To Make Money Day Trading?\\nWhile it may feel like it‚Äôs easy to make a couple of lucky moves and turn a profit from some trades, it isn‚Äôt easy to make money day trading. Again, it‚Äôs very, very risky, and new traders would do well not to assume they‚Äôre going to make any money at all. That said, there are professional traders out there, but they use professional-grade tools and experience to help inform their decisions. New traders shouldn‚Äôt expect to emulate a professional trader‚Äôs success.\\nThe Takeaway\\nDay trading involves making short-term stock trades in an effort to generate returns. It can be lucrative, but is extremely risky, and prospective traders would likely do well to practice and learn some tools of the trade before giving it a shot. They‚Äôll also want to closely consider their risk tolerance, too.\\nAgain, while stock investing can be an important way to build wealth for individuals, it‚Äôs crucial however to know that the consequences of risky day trading can be catastrophic. Investors need to be disciplined, cautious and put in the time and effort before delving into day trading strategies.'),\n",

But each asset is different, and the markets may not behave the same ways, either. As such, traders may want to do some homework before jumping in.\\nHow much capital is typically required to implement day trading strategies?\\nIt‚Äôs generally recommended that traders start with at least $25,000 in their brokerage accounts before day trading.\\nAre there any specific timeframes or market conditions that are more favorable for day trading strategies?\\nPerhaps the best times of the day for day traders are immediately after the markets open, and shortly before they close.
